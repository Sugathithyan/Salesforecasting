# Sales Forecasting using time-series analysis

## Overview
This project is a web application designed for sales forecasting using the ARIMA model. 
It includes a front-end built with Angular for user interaction and a back-end implemented with Flask for data processing and model computation.
The application allows users to register, login, upload CSV files with sales data, and view forecasts and metrics generated by the ARIMA model.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: User registration and login functionalities,Password validation and error handling for mismatched passwords.

2. **File Upload**: Users can upload CSV files containing sales data,File validation to ensure only CSV files are uploaded.

3. **Sales Forecasting**: Backend processes the uploaded file and runs the ARIMA model,Generates forecasts for future sales based on historical data.

4. **Visualization**: Graphical representation of historical and forecasted sales data using Chart.js,Display of various metrics such as RMSE and Mean Squared Error.

5. **Navigation**: Smooth navigation between signup, login, file upload, and display pages.


## Technologies Used
**Frontend**
 - Angular: Framework for building dynamic web applications.
 - HTML/CSS: Markup and styling of the web pages.
 - Angular Material: UI component library for Angular.
 - Chart.js: Library for creating charts to visualize data.
**Backend**
- Flask: Web framework for building the backend API.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- Statsmodels: Statistical modeling library for implementing the ARIMA model.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for calculating metrics.
- MongoDB: Database for storing user data and files.
- PyMongo: Python driver for MongoDB.

**Installation** 
  **Prerequisites**
- Node.js and npm: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed for the Angular front-end.
- Python and pip: Ensure Python and pip are installed for the Flask backend.
- MongoDB: A running MongoDB instance or access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster.

1. **Frontend (Angular)**:

   - Clone the Repository:
     ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
      cd your-repo/frontend

   - Run commands:
       ```bash
       npm install
       ng serve

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:4200.

2. **Backend (Flask)**

    - Clone the Repository:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
      cd your-repo/backend

   - Create a Virtual Environment:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

   - Install Dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt

   - Set Up MongoDB Connection:
   - Run the Flask Application:
     ```bash
     python app.py

The API will be accessible at http://localhost:5000/api.

3. MongoDB Setup:
   
   - Create an account and a new cluster on MongoDB Atlas.
   - Get the connection string and replace the con_string in RestAPI/endpoints.py

- Install MongoDB locally and start the MongoDB service.
- Ensure the con_string in RestAPI/endpoints.py points to your local instance.
- Running the Application

4.**Run Application by :**

    ```bash
    #Start Frontend 
    cd frontend
    ng serve
    #Start Backend 
    cd backend
    source venv/bin/activate
    python app.py

5. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:4200. You can now register, login, upload CSV files, and view sales forecasts.
